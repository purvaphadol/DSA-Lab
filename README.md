# Data Structures & Algorithms Laboratory

This repository contains the assignments I completed as part of the Data Structures & Algorithms Laboratory course under the 2019 pattern syllabus for the Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering at Pune University (SPPU).

The assignments in this repository focus on implementing and understanding various data structures and algorithms, fundamental to computer science and engineering. Each assignment corresponds to a specific concept or data structure, and the solutions are implemented in C++ or Java as specified.

## Assignments Overview

### Assignment 1: Implementation of Shell and Heap Sort Algorithm
- **Description**: This assignment involves implementing either the Heap Sort or Shell Sort algorithm in Java. The objective is to demonstrate the use of the heap or shell data structure to sort the array.
- **File Name**: `ShellSort.java`

### Assignment 2: Hash Table Implementation for Telephone Book
- **Description**: This assignment implements a hash table for storing a telephone book database with basic functionalities such as insertion, display, search, and delete. The hash table uses a simple hash function based on the client's telephone number and applies linear probing for collision handling.
- **File Name**: `hash.cpp`

### Assignment 3: Dictionary (ADT) Implementation using Hashing
- **Description**: This assignment implements all the functions of a dictionary Abstract Data Type (ADT) using hashing. The implementation handles collisions using chaining, ensuring that keys, which are unique and comparable, are efficiently mapped to their corresponding values.
- **File Name**: `hashDic.cpp`

### Assignment 4: Binary Search Tree Operations
- **Description**: This assignment demonstrates various operations on a Binary Search Tree (BST). Starting with an empty tree, it allows for insertion of new nodes, finding the total number of nodes, retrieving the maximum and minimum data values, performing different types of tree traversals (Inorder, Preorder, and Postorder), searching for a specific value, and determining the height of the tree.
- **File Name**: `bst.cpp`

### Assignment 5: Construct an Expression Tree
- **Description**: This assignment constructs an expression tree from a given prefix expression and traverses it using Post Order Traversal. The expression tree is built according to the prefix notation, where operators precede their operands.
- **File Name**: `exptree.cpp`

### Assignment 6: Dictionary Management using Binary Search Tree
- **Description**: This C++ program implements a dictionary using a Binary Search Tree (BST). It provides functionalities for adding new keywords, deleting keywords, updating the meanings of existing entries, and displaying the entire dictionary sorted in both ascending and descending order. The program supports non-recursive traversal methods for inorder and postorder.
- **File Name**: `bstdi.cpp`

### Assignment 7: Representation of Graph using Adjacency List for College Map
- **Description**: This program models a college area map using landmarks as nodes and paths between them as edges. It represents the graph using an adjacency list for BFS (Breadth-First Search) and an adjacency matrix for DFS (Depth-First Search). The program allows for the insertion of landmarks and paths, and supports both recursive and non-recursive DFS as well as BFS. Users can view landmarks, display routes, and perform graph traversals to explore the connections between different landmarks.
- **File Name**: `dfsbfs.cpp`

### Assignment 8: Flight Management System
- **Description**: The Flight Management System represents a network of cities connected by flights, with each flight characterized by fuel consumption and travel time. The system uses an adjacency list to store and manage the relationships between cities and their respective flights. Users can add cities, insert flight routes, and query the system to find cities and routes.
- **File Name**: `flightlist.cpp`

### Assignment 9: AVL Tree Dictionary
- **Description**: This program implements an AVL tree-based dictionary for managing words and their meanings. AVL trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree where the difference in heights of left and right subtrees of any node is no more than one.
- **File Name**: `avl.cpp`

### Assignment 10: Finding Maximum and Minimum Marks Using Heaps
- **Description**: This C++ program reads the marks obtained by students in an online examination and determines the maximum and minimum marks using heap data structures. After inserting all student marks into both heaps, the program retrieves and displays the maximum and minimum values efficiently.
- **File Name**: `heap.cpp`
